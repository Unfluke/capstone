Option writers thrive on getting benefit of theta decay in the options that they short. The most common strategy is to sell At-The-Money Call and Put, and then under correct risk parameters, buy back the call and put, when they have reduced due to theta decay. However, there are few caveats. Firstly, it is a well known and tested fact that theta decay happens exponentially fast as we move towards the expiry. So while it is easy to profit from option selling strategies near the expiry, the effect of other greeks can over power the effect of theta at the start of the expiry, and thus making it challenging to benefit from theta decay. Secondly, it is extremely easy to get stopped out at the beginning of the expiry due to delta moves and close to the expiry due to gamma moves. So in this paper, we plan to find the strategies which perform better than vanilla option shorting strategy by using delta move as one of the parameters. Then we perform comprehensive backtest to arrive at optimal parameters to make this a good strategy to take the most benefit.
